        Important! Once a new schema version is added to this sequence and
        released, the particular update should never be changed. Instead, when
        a schema change is needed, a new update should be added that modifies
        the schema created in earlier versions, and migrates data that is
        already present in the DB.

        Remember, these updates may be applied to a DB in _any_ previously-
        deployed version, and they always need to produce a DB having the final
        expected schema.

        Exceptions should be considered if, for example:
        - You are _certain_ that a particular schema version has never been
        deployed to a "production" system. This probably applies only to
        changing the latest update during development.
        - The change is merely syntactic, and doesn't affect the behavior of
        any query _or_ any subsequent update.
